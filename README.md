## INTRODUCTION
This project uses different types of charts and graphs for interactive visualization of filtered data.  
The data is collected from DonorsChoose.org, a US public charity that provides a fund-raising platform for school projects.

This project also makes use of dc, d3 and crossfilter to render the data visualization using charts and graphs.
